# UND-Flight-Restriction-Scrape
This python program uses the python request library to get the data from the UND Aims flight restriction website. It also gets the current metar data for the KGFK metar. It then stres that data to a JSON file. 
The python program called Spreadsheet.py can then take that data and put it into a spreadsheet. This can help you gain a better understanding of the data through the use of graphs.
